# SignUp Component

The `SignUp` component is responsible for rendering a sign-up form where users can create an account. It utilizes the Firebase Authentication service to handle user registration securely. This component provides a user-friendly interface for entering email, password, and confirming the password.

## Features

### Sign-Up Form

The main feature of this component is the sign-up form, which allows users to register by providing their email address, password, and confirming the password. The form is designed to be easy to use and visually appealing.

### Password Confirmation

To ensure that users have entered the correct password, the component includes a password confirmation field. If the entered passwords do not match, an error message will be displayed, guiding users to provide matching passwords.

### Firebase Authentication Integration

The component integrates with Firebase Authentication to securely handle user registration. It uses the `signup` function from the `useAuth` context to create a new user account. If any errors occur during the registration process, appropriate error messages are displayed.

### Error Handling

The component includes error handling mechanisms to display meaningful error messages to users. For instance, if the user attempts to sign up with an email that is already registered, an error message will be shown, and the user will be prompted to try again or log in.

### Loading and Button States

To provide a smooth user experience, the sign-up button has different states. While the sign-up process is in progress, the button will be disabled and show a loading spinner. This prevents users from submitting the form multiple times and ensures that the application's state is accurately represented to the user.

### Social Login Options

Users have the option to sign up using their existing social media accounts, such as Facebook, Google, or Apple. These options provide convenience and familiarity for users who may prefer to use their existing credentials.

## Usage

1. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

2. Import the `SignUp` component into your project:

```jsx
import SignUp from './path/to/SignUp';
```

3. Use the SignUp component within your application, placing it where you want the sign-up form to appear:

```jsx
<SignUp>
```
