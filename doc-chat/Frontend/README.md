## Why I Built It.
The Doctor's Consultation App is designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers, especially for those who may face challenges in accessing quality healthcare. The app provides a platform for patients to consult with licensed doctors from different parts of the world, regardless of their location.<br/>
 This is particularly useful for individuals living in remote areas where access to healthcare is limited, or those with mobility challenges. <br/>.
he app aims to provide a more efficient and cost-effective way of receiving medical attention. Patients can avoid the inconvenience of booking appointments, waiting in long queues, and paying for transportation to visit a physical clinic. Instead, they can receive medical advice and prescriptions online, which saves them time and money.
The Doctor's Consultation App also promotes continuity of care by enabling patients to have access to their medical history and previous diagnoses. Patients can easily access their medical records and share them with their doctors during online consultations.<br/>
 This improves the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment, especially in cases where patients have pre-existing medical condition
